In order to compile the source code, just type in the
 following command: make run2
  You can update filex and filey, as this command takes in filex and filey
  as args.Alternatively, you can do:
  ./program1 filex.txt filey.txt output.txt

This is a simply implementation of the recursive
lcs algorithm

NOTE: you must remove the output.txt file before running any program,
if the output.txt exists. This can be done with a "make clean",
or the old fashioned way
