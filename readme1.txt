In order to compile the source code, just type in the
 following command: make run1
  You can update filex and filey, as this command takes in filex and filey
  as args

In this program, I created a separate object class called Entry, which stores
an integer value, and a direction. program1.cpp contains a two dimensional array
of Entries (called matrix). This 2D array is a representation of the dynamic
programming table mentioned in lectures 15-16.

NOTE: you must remove the output.txt file before running any program,
if the output.txt exists. This can be done with a "make clean",
or the old fashioned way
